# Project Brief: Wake the Nile Custom WordPress Plugin

## Core Mission

This project is a custom WordPress plugin designed to add bespoke functionality to the "Wake the Nile" website. Its primary purpose is to extend the site's features beyond standard WordPress capabilities, providing tailored content display options and integrations.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Video Slider:** Implement a dynamic, touch-friendly video carousel using a shortcode.
2.  **Show/Event Management:** Provide custom Gutenberg blocks to display detailed information for a "show" custom post type, including venue, date/time, ticket links, and an interactive map.
3.  **Ease of Use:** Enable content creators to easily add complex components like video sliders and show details directly within the WordPress block editor without writing any code.
4.  **Integrations:** Integrate with the Google Maps API to display venue locations.
