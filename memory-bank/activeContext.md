# Active Context: Coverflow Effect Implementation from Example

## Current Focus

The current focus is to implement the coverflow effect from the Glide.js website example, ensuring it is responsive and performant.

## Recent Changes

*   **Updated `includes/shortcodes.php`**:
    *   Modified the `[glide]` shortcode to generate the HTML structure from the example, including the `frames__item` and `frame` elements.
    *   Updated the class names for the slider container and arrows to match the example.
*   **Updated `css/styles.css`**:
    *   Replaced the existing slider styles with the styles from the example.
*   **Updated `js/autoplay.js`**:
    *   Replaced the previous `Coverflow` module with the one from the example.
    *   Updated the `glideOptions` to match the settings from the example.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the recent changes.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   When implementing a complex visual effect from an example, it's crucial to replicate the HTML structure, CSS, and JavaScript as closely as possible.
*   Minified JavaScript can be difficult to read, but it's possible to extract the key information by analyzing the code structure and looking for familiar patterns.
