# Active Context: Coverflow Effect Enhancement

## Current Focus

The current focus is to enhance the video slider with a more dynamic and visually appealing coverflow effect, while ensuring it remains performant and responsive.

## Recent Changes

*   **Updated `css/styles.css`**:
    *   Modified the `.glide__track` to use `overflow: visible`, `transform-style: preserve-3d`, and `perspective: 800px` to create a 3D environment for the slider.
    *   Updated the `.glide__slide` transition to include `filter` for smoother brightness changes.
*   **Updated `js/autoplay.js`**:
    *   Replaced the `simplifiedCoverflow` function with a new `Coverflow` module.
    *   The new module calculates and applies 3D transformations (`translateX`, `translateZ`, `rotateY`, `scale`) to each slide based on its position relative to the active slide.
    *   The module also adjusts the `zIndex` and `opacity` of the slides to create a sense of depth.
    *   The brightness of the video elements is adjusted based on their distance from the center.

## Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the recent changes.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   A classic coverflow effect can be achieved by combining CSS 3D transforms with a JavaScript module that dynamically calculates the position of each slide.
*   Using `perspective` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` is essential for creating a 3D space.
*   The `will-change` CSS property can be used to optimize the performance of animations.
*   It's important to ensure that complex visual effects are responsive and work well on a variety of screen sizes.
