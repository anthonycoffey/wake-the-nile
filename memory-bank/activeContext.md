# Active Context: Video Slider Re-Implementation

## Current Focus

The task is to fix the video slider's off-center track and incorrect button behavior on desktop, aiming for a classic coverflow look and feel. The previous fix was insufficient.

## Recent Changes

*   **`js/glide-init.js`**:
    *   Replaced the complex, rotation-based coverflow effect with a simplified version that uses scaling (`transform: scale(0.85)`) and brightness to create a more stable, classic coverflow appearance.
    *   Updated the Glide.js options for a `carousel` type, with `perView: 3` on desktop and `perView: 1` on tablet/mobile, ensuring the centered slide is always the focus.

*   **`css/styles.css`**:
    *   Completely refactored the slider CSS.
    *   Removed `overflow: visible` and instead wrapped the slider in a `.glide-container` which has a `max-width` and `overflow: hidden` to properly center and contain the slider.
    *   Updated slide styles to support the new scaling effect and ensure vertical alignment.
    *   Corrected the positioning of the navigation arrows to be on the left and right sides below the slider, using `justify-content: space-between`.

*   **`index.php`**:
    *   Added the new `.glide-container` wrapper div around the slider HTML in the `glide_shortcode` function to enable the new centering and containment strategy.
    *   Fixed a critical bug in the HTML generation for the right navigation arrow.

## Next Steps

1.  Verify that the new coverflow implementation is centered, responsive, and that the navigation works as expected on all screen sizes.
2.  Await further instructions.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   Complex visual effects like coverflow often require a combination of proper HTML structure (wrapper elements), CSS for containment (`overflow: hidden`), and simplified JavaScript logic. Relying only on transforms without proper containment can lead to layout issues.
*   A "classic" coverflow effect can be achieved more reliably with scaling and opacity/filter changes rather than complex 3D rotations, which are harder to make responsive and centered.
