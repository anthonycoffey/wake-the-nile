# Active Context: Video Slider Mobile Responsiveness

## Current Focus

The primary task is to improve the responsiveness of the video slider on small mobile screens, where the content and navigation buttons were being vertically clipped. The solution must respect the aspect ratio of the portrait videos.

## Recent Changes

*   **`js/glide-init.js`**:
    *   Adjusted the Glide.js `breakpoints` configuration for mobile screens (`max-width: 768px`).
    *   Reduced the `gap` between slides from `100` to `20` to decrease the overall width and prevent unnecessary horizontal space when `perView` is 1.

*   **`css/styles.css`**:
    *   Added a new media query for mobile screens (`max-width: 768px`).
    *   Reduced the vertical `padding` on the main `.glide-container`.
    *   Reduced the `margin-top` on the `.glide__arrows` container to bring the navigation closer to the slider.
    *   Decreased the `width` and `height` of the `.glide__arrow` buttons to make them more proportional to smaller screens.
    *   Made the video container (`.glide__slide-inner`) a flex container to center the video.
    *   Reduced the `max-width` of the video itself to `80%` on mobile to decrease its overall size and prevent vertical clipping of the navigation.

## Next Steps

1.  The final requested change to the video slider has been implemented.
2.  Await further instructions.

## Key Learnings & Insights

*   When dealing with responsive video, directly constraining the height of a container can lead to undesirable letterboxing or aspect ratio distortion. A better approach is to constrain the width and allow the height to adjust automatically.
*   For centering elements like a `<video>` tag whose `max-width` has been reduced, `margin: 0 auto;` can be unreliable. A more robust solution is to make the parent element a flex container with `display: flex;` and `justify-content: center;`.
*   Small adjustments to layout properties can have a significant impact on usability on small viewports without requiring major structural changes.
