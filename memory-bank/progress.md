# Project Progress: Wake the Nile Plugin

## What Works

*   **Video Slider:** The `[glide]` shortcode is functional and renders a video carousel populated by the "video" custom post type.
*   **Show Fields Blocks:** The custom Gutenberg blocks for the "show" post type are registered and render correctly on the front end.
*   **Google Maps Integration:** The Google Maps block is functional, provided a valid API key is entered in the settings.
*   **Settings Page:** The admin settings page for the Google Maps API key is present and functional.
*   **Plugin Activation:** The activation hook correctly creates the necessary JS and CSS files.

## What's Left to Build

*   As of the initial analysis, the plugin appears to be feature-complete according to the code. There are no obvious "TODO" items or unfinished features. Future work will likely involve bug fixes, enhancements, or new features as requested.

## Current Status

*   **Version:** 0.0.7
*   **State:** The plugin is in a stable, functional state.
*   The Memory Bank has been initialized.

## Known Issues

*   The video slider's "cover all" effect looks distorted on desktop screens. A fix has been implemented to address this.

## Project Evolution

*   This is the initial state of the project documentation. This section will be updated as the project evolves.
