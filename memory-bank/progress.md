# Project Progress: Wake the Nile Plugin

## What Works

*   **Video Slider:** The `[glide]` shortcode is functional and renders a video carousel populated by the "video" custom post type.
*   **Show Fields Blocks:** The custom Gutenberg blocks for the "show" post type are registered and render correctly on the front end.
*   **Google Maps Integration:** The Google Maps block is functional, provided a valid API key is entered in the settings.
*   **Settings Page:** The admin settings page for the Google Maps API key is present and functional.
*   **Plugin Activation:** The activation hook correctly creates the necessary JS and CSS files.

## What's Left to Build

*   The plugin is feature-complete according to the original requirements. Future work will likely involve bug fixes, enhancements, or new features as requested.

## Current Status

*   **Version:** 0.0.7
*   **State:** The plugin is in a stable, functional state.
*   The Memory Bank has been initialized.

## Known Issues

*   All known issues have been addressed.

## Project Evolution

*   **Version Management:** The plugin's version number is now dynamically sourced from the main plugin file's header comment. This makes version updates easier and less error-prone by establishing a single source of truth.
*   **Video Slider Re-implementation:** The video slider has been completely refactored to provide a stable, classic coverflow effect. The new implementation uses a combination of a containing wrapper, overflow clipping, and simplified scale/brightness transforms to ensure it is centered and responsive on all devices. This replaces a previous, more complex 3D rotation effect that was causing layout and navigation issues.
*   This is the initial state of the project documentation. This section will be updated as the project evolves.
