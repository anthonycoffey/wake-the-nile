# Project Progress: Wake the Nile Plugin

## What Works

*   **Video Slider:** The `[glide]` shortcode is functional and renders a video carousel populated by the "video" custom post type. The slider is responsive on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Show Fields Blocks:** The custom Gutenberg blocks for the "show" post type are registered and render correctly on the front end.
*   **Google Maps Integration:** The Google Maps block is functional, provided a valid API key is entered in the settings. The Maps JavaScript API is now loaded using the stable `quarterly` channel.
*   **Settings Page:** The admin settings page for the Google Maps API key is present and functional.
*   **Plugin Activation:** The activation hook correctly creates the necessary JS and CSS files.
*   **Dashicons on Frontend:** The Dashicons icon library is now available on the front end of the site.

## What's Left to Build

*   The plugin is feature-complete according to the original requirements. Future work will likely involve bug fixes, enhancements, or new features as requested.

## Recent Updates

*   **Dashicons Enqueued:** The Dashicons stylesheet is now enqueued on the front end, making it available for use in the theme.
*   **Google Maps API Stability:** Updated the Google Maps JavaScript API to use the `quarterly` version channel. This improves the stability and predictability of the map feature by avoiding weekly, potentially breaking changes.
*   **City/State Block:** Added a new `show-fields/city-state` block to display show locations.
*   **Tickets Link Enhancement:** The `show-fields/tickets-link` block now opens links in a new tab by default for a better user experience.

## Current Status

*   **Version:** 0.1.9
*   **State:** The plugin is in a stable, functional state.
*   The Memory Bank has been updated.

## Known Issues

*   All known issues have been addressed.

## Project Evolution

*   **Advanced Mobile Responsiveness (Video Slider):** Further refined the mobile view of the video slider to address vertical clipping on smaller screens. The solution involved making the video's parent a flex container to handle centering, and then reducing the `max-width` of the video itself to `80%` within a media query. This preserves the aspect ratio while shrinking the video's vertical footprint.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness (Video Slider):** Addressed an issue where the video slider and its controls were vertically clipped on small mobile screens. The fix involved adjusting the slider's `gap` in JavaScript and using a CSS media query to reduce vertical padding and margins, ensuring the video's aspect ratio is preserved while improving the layout on smaller viewports.
*   **Version Management:** The plugin's version number is now dynamically sourced from the main plugin file's header comment. This makes version updates easier and less error-prone by establishing a single source of truth.
*   **Coverflow Effect Enhancement:** The video slider's coverflow effect has been significantly enhanced to be more dynamic and visually appealing. The new implementation uses CSS 3D transforms (`perspective`, `rotateY`, `translateX`, `translateZ`) to create a classic, iPod-style carousel. The effect is fully responsive and performance-optimized. This replaces the previous, simplified scale-and-brightness effect.
*   **Video Slider Re-implementation:** The video slider has been completely refactored to provide a stable, classic coverflow effect. The new implementation uses a combination of a containing wrapper, overflow clipping, and simplified scale/brightness transforms to ensure it is centered and responsive on all devices. This replaces a previous, more complex 3D rotation effect that was causing layout and navigation issues.
*   This is the initial state of the project documentation. This section will be updated as the project evolves.
