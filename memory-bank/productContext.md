# Product Context: Wake the Nile Plugin

## The Problem

The "Wake the Nile" website requires specialized features that are not available in off-the-shelf WordPress plugins. The site needs to showcase video content in an engaging way and display detailed, consistently formatted information for events or shows. Building these features manually for each page would be time-consuming, error-prone, and would require technical expertise.

## The Solution

This plugin solves the problem by providing two core pieces of functionality:

1.  **A `[glide]` shortcode:** This allows an administrator to easily insert a video carousel into any page or post. The slider is populated with content from a "video" custom post type, ensuring that the video management is centralized and straightforward.
2.  **"Show Fields" Gutenberg Blocks:** A suite of custom blocks that are specifically designed to work with a "show" custom post type. These blocks allow for the easy insertion of venue names, show dates, ticket links, and Google Maps, ensuring a consistent and professional look for all show listings.

## User Experience Goals

*   **For Content Creators:** The primary goal is to empower non-technical users to manage and display complex content with ease. The interface should be intuitive, leveraging the familiar WordPress block editor.
*   **For Site Visitors:** The features should be seamless and enhance the user's experience. The video slider should be responsive and easy to navigate. Show information should be clear, accurate, and provide all necessary details, including an interactive map for directions.
